D3.js is a javascript library that uses documents based on data to create interactive & dynamic visualizations; the D3 stands for Data-Driven Document. Mike Bostock is one of the main developers for D3.js.

Javascript is a scripting language that is embedded in the HTML to make web pages interactive and dynamics. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an image format that is necessary for javascript to bind with its elements, and make them interactive.

Why use D3.js?
  - visualizations created with R are static, unless used in conjunction with a package,
  but even then, it won't be as customization as using javascript.
  - we'll show you why in a bit.
  - nonetheless, R produces great plots through packages like ggplot2
  - again, even with added packages, the customization are predetermined??
  - using javascript and the D3.js library makes binding javascript to data points

The structure of an HTML source code is as follows:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <script> Javascript here </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### 2 Methods for creating interactive plots

  1. Use R for data processing and creating a graphic. The we export the graphic in SVG format and bind javascript to the elements we desire.
  Example of manually binding javascript: (http://vanhumbeecka.github.io/R-and-D3/svg-simple.html)
    - manually binding the javascript can be done of course, but it's a hassle
    - we have packages that complete the javascript binding for us, e.g. plotly
      - plotly examples: (http://vanhumbeecka.github.io/R-and-D3/plotly.html)

  2. Use R only for data processing & use javascript for entire visualization process. We get more customization & these can potentially result in some pretty graphics. Here is an example that may or may not have been tidied up in R: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/here-s-visual-proof-why-vaccines-do-more-good-harm
  
Both methods require the use of javascript to create these customized plots.

#### Final words
- the D3.js library provides functions that makes it easier to customize graphics with data in consideration. 
- utilizing javascript may be more work than required for some basic plots -- we can just use R. 
- javascript allows you to make tweeks in graphics, and if they're 'data-driven' then D3 will be helpful.
- Unless, we wanted immense customization to create something novel, perhaps using R or other packages like plotly may be enough.
- Fortunately, Mike  Bostock and other developers are creating R packages t integrt integrate D3.js libraries for particular plots. E.g. scatterD3, sunburstR, d3r.
